Downloaded Superstore data from Kaggle
Assigned Data in correct data types (Numbers, Strings, Date, etc)
Removed temporal anomalies (Delivery Date preceding the Order Date)
Created calculated columns for production cost and profit (As it was not mentioned in the Data)
Added conditional formatting (bar type) to showcase sales contribution for product categories 
Created a "measure" called "Customer Base" to find how many customers Superstore has in each region
