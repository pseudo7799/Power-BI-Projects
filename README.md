2) SHIPPING MEASUREMENT - Which regions must see reduction in delivery time to increase customer satisfaction ? (Assuming it is directly related to sales)



Data Insights -

Performing all analysis with product category as base.
The superstore has 17 product categories, some of them are mentioned below,

1) Chairs: ![image](https://github.com/pseudo7799/Power-BI-Projects/assets/156554807/c4bb583c-2638-440d-aa01-be8d42479b11)

SALES AND PROFITABILITY MEASUREMENT: Top performer in sales and strong sales-profit relationship.
SHIPPING MEASUREMENT: 1) Find relationship between delivery time and sales in the east region ( NY and PA states specifically) ( Map helps pinpoint states to focus on) 
                      Reason = East Region has significantly higher delivery time than other regions
                      2) South region has lowest delivery time and yet lowest sales as well, why? 

2) Phones: ![image](https://github.com/pseudo7799/Power-BI-Projects/assets/156554807/c3037a3e-5d99-4281-ada3-3b0ba4c79fa3)

SALES AND PROFITABILITY MEASUREMENT: 1) High performer and strong sales-profit relationship. Why sudden jump in sales in 2018, is it related to a region? new product? how to keep it going?                                         2) South Region has the lowest sales and customer base, why is that?
SHIPPING MEASUREMENT: Pretty much the same for all regions.

3) Machines: ![image](https://github.com/pseudo7799/Power-BI-Projects/assets/156554807/404f579c-924a-41ed-8922-526beef473b6)

SALES AND PROFITABILITY MEASUREMENT: Sales have cyclical realtionship with time but sales-profit relationship is growing steadily. Profit Margins are the highest for this category (61%) and as sales-profit relationsip is growing linearly (profit margin may not be related to reduced sales), Superstore should focus more on increasing the customer base than reducing profit margins.

SHIPPING MEASUREMENT: Central region has very high delivery time but it looks like it has very low demand hence we can go 2 different routes 1) overlook that 2) investigate if higher delivery time has to do anything with lower sales

SALES AND PROFITABILITY MEASUREMENT: Steady growth in sales and profitability.
SHIPPING MEASUREMENT: South Region has very high delivery time and very low sales. Considering the trend for other 3 regions, we can say delivery time and sales is directly proprotional.



Similarly, Superstore can find out the areas of improvement for other product categories.


Additional Analysis - 
1) South Region has the lowest customer base, lowest sales for every single product category.
2) Consumer segment makes 50% of all sales among Consumer, Home Office and Corporate segments.
